# LeadAr Test Project

## 📝 Description

This is a test landing page project for the LeadAr company. The site is built from scratch without using bundlers (like webpack or Vite), with a focus on responsiveness, clean code, and user interaction logic.

The page includes:
- Two authentication/registration forms that toggle between each other.
- Responsive sliders (with auto-scroll at specific intervals and swipe support on mobile devices).
- Smooth scroll to the form section.
- Input validation (if needed).
- Styling based on the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.
